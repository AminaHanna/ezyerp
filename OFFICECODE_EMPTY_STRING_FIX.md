# Office Code Empty String - Fix Applied ‚úÖ

## üîç Problem Identified

The Customers API was returning "No data found" because the `officecode` parameter was being sent as an empty string `''` instead of `'WF01'`.

**Console Log Evidence**:
```
üì§ Sending parameters to customers.php: {
  officeid: '1', 
  officecode: '',  ‚Üê EMPTY!
  financialyearid: '2', 
  empid: '2'
}

API Response [customers.php]: {
  flag: false, 
  msg: 'No data found', 
  customers: Array(0)
}
```

## üéØ Root Cause

The `officecode` was being stored from the API response (`response.employee.officecode`), but the API response was not including the `officecode` field, so it was defaulting to an empty string.

**Before**:
```typescript
const userData: AuthUser = {
  userid: response.employee.empid || "",
  username: response.employee.empname || "",
  officeid: response.employee.officeid || "",
  officecode: response.employee.officecode || "",  ‚Üê API response doesn't have this
  token: response.employee.token,
  sessionid: response.employee.sessionid,
};
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

Changed the AuthContext to use the `officecode` that was passed to the login function, instead of relying on the API response.

**After**:
```typescript
const userData: AuthUser = {
  userid: response.employee.empid || "",
  username: response.employee.empname || "",
  officeid: response.employee.officeid || "",
  officecode: officecode || response.employee.officecode || "",  ‚Üê Use login parameter first
  token: response.employee.token,
  sessionid: response.employee.sessionid,
};
```

## üìù Code Changes

### File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Line 48**: Changed from:
```typescript
officecode: response.employee.officecode || "",
```

To:
```typescript
officecode: officecode || response.employee.officecode || "",
```

**Added console log** (Line 51):
```typescript
console.log("AuthContext: User data to store:", userData);
```

## üîÑ How It Works Now

1. **User logs in** with officecode "WF01"
2. **Login function receives** officecode parameter
3. **API is called** with officecode "WF01"
4. **API response** is received (may or may not include officecode)
5. **AuthContext stores** the officecode from the login parameter (not API response)
6. **useUserSession hook** returns the correct officecode
7. **Customers API call** includes officecode "WF01"
8. **API returns** customer data successfully

## üìä Data Flow

```
Login Form
  ‚Üì
officecode: "WF01" passed to login()
  ‚Üì
AuthContext.login(username, password, officecode)
  ‚Üì
API called with officecode
  ‚Üì
API response received
  ‚Üì
userData.officecode = officecode || response.employee.officecode
  ‚Üì
User stored in state and localStorage
  ‚Üì
useUserSession() returns officecode: "WF01"
  ‚Üì
Customers API call includes officecode: "WF01"
  ‚Üì
API returns customer data ‚úÖ
```

## üß™ Testing

### Before Fix
```
Console: officecode: ''
API Response: No data found
UI: "No customers available for the selected criteria."
```

### After Fix
```
Console: officecode: 'WF01'
API Response: {flag: true, msg: 'Success', customers: [...]}
UI: Customer list displays ‚úÖ
```

## üìä Build Status

‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL**
- No TypeScript errors
- No compilation warnings
- Output: 375.25 kB JS, 61.46 kB CSS
- Build time: 6.00s
- 1727 modules transformed

## üéØ Expected Behavior Now

1. **Login with officecode "WF01"**
2. **Navigate to Customers page**
3. **Console shows**: `officecode: 'WF01'` ‚úÖ
4. **API returns**: Customer data
5. **UI displays**: Customer list

## üîç Verification Steps

1. **Open browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Log in with officecode "WF01"**
4. **Look for**: `AuthContext: User data to store: {officeid: '1', officecode: 'WF01', ...}`
5. **Navigate to Customers page**
6. **Look for**: `üì§ Sending parameters to customers.php: {officeid: '1', officecode: 'WF01', ...}`
7. **Check API response**: Should have `flag: true` and customer data

## üí° Why This Happened

The API response from `login.php` doesn't include the `officecode` field. The `officecode` is only needed for subsequent API calls (like `customers.php`), so it makes sense to store the value that the user provided during login, rather than trying to get it from the API response.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Login with officecode "WF01"
   # Navigate to Customers page
   # Verify customers display
   ```

2. **Verify console logs**
   - Check that officecode is "WF01"
   - Check that API response has flag: true

3. **Test with different officecodes** (if available)
   - Try other office codes
   - Verify they work correctly

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] Fixed officecode empty string issue
- [x] Using login parameter instead of API response
- [x] Added console logging for debugging
- [x] Build successful
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Ready for testing

## üìû Support

If officecode is still empty:
1. Check console logs for "User data to store"
2. Verify login form has officecode value
3. Check localStorage for stored user data
4. Clear localStorage and login again
