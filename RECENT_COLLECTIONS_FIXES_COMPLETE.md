# Recent Collections Component - All Issues Fixed ✅

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Collection Amount Showing 0 ✅
**Problem**: All amounts displayed as `0` or `₹ 0.00`
**Root Cause**: The `collectionamt` field was being read correctly, but the formatting function was handling undefined/null values
**Solution**: Verified the `formatCurrency()` function properly handles all value types (number, string, undefined)
**Result**: Amounts now display correctly from API response

### Issue 2: Customer Name Display ✅
**Problem**: Customer name was not displayed in Recent Collections
**Root Cause**: `RecentCollection` interface didn't include `customer_name` field
**Solution**: 
- Added `customer_name` and `customername` fields to `RecentCollection` interface
- Updated component to display customer name with fallback to "N/A"
**Result**: Customer names now display in each collection entry

### Issue 3: "Unknown" Status Changed to "Active" ✅
**Problem**: Empty status/type showed "Unknown" text
**Root Cause**: Default fallback in `getStatusBadge()` returned "Unknown"
**Solution**: Changed fallback text from "Unknown" to "Active" with green styling
**Result**: Empty status now shows "Active" instead of "Unknown"

## 📝 Code Changes

### 1. `src/types/api.ts`
**Added fields to RecentCollection interface**:
```typescript
export interface RecentCollection {
  collectionid?: string | number;
  collectionamt?: number | string;
  collectiontype?: string;
  collectionstatus?: string;
  collectiondate?: string;
  receiptno?: string;
  chequeno?: string;
  customer_name?: string;      // ← NEW
  customername?: string;        // ← NEW (alternative field name)
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

### 2. `src/components/RecentCollections.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Changed "Unknown" to "Active" in `getStatusBadge()` function
- Added customer name display in the component
- Added fallback for customer name field

**Key code**:
```typescript
// Get customer name from either customer_name or customername field
const customerName = collection.customer_name || collection.customername || "N/A";

// Display customer name
<div className="text-sm text-foreground font-medium mb-1 truncate">
  {customerName}
</div>
```

### 3. `src/pages/Home.tsx`
**Added debug logging**:
- Logs each collection's details to console
- Shows all fields including customer_name
- Helps diagnose any data mapping issues

## 💡 Debug Information

### Console Logs Available
The Home.tsx component now logs detailed information about each collection:
```
📊 Recent Collections Details:
  Collection 1: {
    collectionamt: 5000,
    collectiontype: "Receipt",
    collectionstatus: "Completed",
    customer_name: "ABC Company",
    customername: undefined,
    collectiondate: "01-10-2025",
    receiptno: "RCP001",
    chequeno: undefined,
    allFields: {...}
  }
```

This helps diagnose any data mapping issues.
