# Login Redirect Issue - Fix Documentation

## 🐛 Issue Description

**Problem**: After successful login, the page remained on the login screen instead of redirecting to the dashboard/home page.

**Root Cause**: **Race Condition** - The `navigate("/")` call was happening before the React state updates were processed.

### What Was Happening

```
1. User clicks "Sign In"
2. handleSubmit() is called
3. login() function is called (async)
4. navigate("/") is called immediately after login() returns
5. BUT: The user state hasn't updated yet in React's state queue
6. ProtectedRoute checks isAuthenticated (which depends on user state)
7. Since user state is still null, isAuthenticated is false
8. ProtectedRoute redirects back to /login
9. User sees login page again
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### The Fix: Use useEffect for Navigation

Instead of calling `navigate()` directly after `login()`, we now:

1. Set a flag `isSubmitting = true` when the form is submitted
2. Call `login()` and wait for it to complete
3. Use a `useEffect` hook to watch for when `isAuthenticated` becomes true
4. When `isAuthenticated` is true AND `isLoading` is false, then navigate

### Code Changes

#### File: `src/pages/Login.tsx`

**1. Added useEffect import**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
```

**2. Added new state and hook**
```typescript
const { login, isLoading, error, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

// Redirect to home page after successful login
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && !isLoading && isSubmitting) {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
    navigate("/");
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, isLoading, isSubmitting, navigate]);
```

**3. Updated handleSubmit function**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setLocalError(null);

  if (!validateForm()) {
    return;
  }

  try {
    setIsSubmitting(true);
    await login(formData.username, formData.password, formData.officecode);
    // Navigation will be handled by useEffect when isAuthenticated becomes true
  } catch (err) {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
    const errorMessage = err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Login failed. Please try again.";
    setLocalError(errorMessage);
  }
};
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Successful Login Flow

```
1. User enters credentials and clicks "Sign In"
2. handleSubmit() sets isSubmitting = true
3. login() is called and awaited
4. AuthContext updates user state
5. AuthContext sets isLoading = false
6. useEffect detects: isAuthenticated=true, isLoading=false, isSubmitting=true
7. useEffect calls navigate("/")
8. User is redirected to home page ✅
```

### Failed Login Flow

```
1. User enters wrong credentials and clicks "Sign In"
2. handleSubmit() sets isSubmitting = true
3. login() throws error
4. catch block sets isSubmitting = false
5. Error message is displayed
6. useEffect doesn't trigger (isAuthenticated is still false)
7. User stays on login page ✅
```

## 📊 Why This Works

### The Problem with Direct Navigation
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Race condition
try {
  await login(...);
  navigate("/");  // Happens before state updates
} catch (err) {
  // ...
}
```

### The Solution with useEffect
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Waits for state updates
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && !isLoading && isSubmitting) {
    navigate("/");
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, isLoading, isSubmitting, navigate]);
```

The `useEffect` hook ensures that:
1. All state updates have been processed
2. React has re-rendered with the new state
3. Navigation happens after the user state is confirmed to be set

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case 1: Successful Login
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/login`
3. Enter credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `1234`
   - Office Code: `WF01`
4. Click "Sign In"
5. **Expected**: Redirect to home page ✅
6. **Verify**: URL changes to `http://localhost:8081/`

### Test Case 2: Failed Login
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter wrong credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `wrong`
   - Office Code: `WF01`
3. Click "Sign In"
4. **Expected**: Stay on login page, error message shown ✅
5. **Verify**: URL is still `/login`

### Test Case 3: Page Refresh After Login
1. Login successfully
2. Refresh page (F5)
3. **Expected**: Stay on home page ✅
4. **Verify**: Session persists from localStorage

|------|---------|-------|
| `src/pages/Login.tsx` | Added useEffect for navigation | 1-84 |

## 🔍 Key Changes Summary

| Change | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Added `useEffect` import | To watch for state changes |
| Added `isSubmitting` state | To track when form is submitted |

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still not redirecting
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Network tab for API response
3. Verify localStorage has auth_user
4. Check if isAuthenticated is true

### Issue: Infinite loading
1. Check if login API is responding
2. Verify credentials are correct
3. Check Network tab for API errors
4. Check browser console for errors
